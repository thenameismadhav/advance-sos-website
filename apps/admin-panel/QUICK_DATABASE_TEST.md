# 🔍 Quick Database Connection Test

## **Before running the full schema, test basic connectivity:**

### 1. **Test Basic Connection**
Go to your app: http://localhost:8081/admin
- Click "Connection Test" 
- Should show: ✅ Database Connection: Successful

### 2. **If Connection Fails:**
- Check your Supabase project is active
- Verify API key is correct
- Ensure no network issues

### 3. **If Connection Works:**
- Proceed with running `supabase_schema.sql`
- This will create all the tables needed for real-time sync

## **Expected Results After Schema:**

✅ **Connection Test:**
- Environment Variables: ✓ All detected
- Supabase Client: ✓ Created successfully  
- Network Connectivity: ✓ Successful
- Database Connection: ✓ Successful
- Authentication Service: ✓ Working
- CSP Check: ✓ Allows Supabase

✅ **Live Data Sync Test:**
- WebSocket: ✓ Active
- Real-time: ✓ Working
- All tables: ✓ Receiving updates

## **The Issue:**
Your database tables don't exist yet, so real-time subscriptions can't connect to them. Running the schema will fix this immediately.
